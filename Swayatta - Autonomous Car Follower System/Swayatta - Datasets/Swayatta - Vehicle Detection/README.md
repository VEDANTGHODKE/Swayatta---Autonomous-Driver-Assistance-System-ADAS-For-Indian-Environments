In order to train and evaluate an object detector capable of predicting a 2D bounding box around the chased RC car in an image, a dataset was needed. The collected dataset consists of 460 manually annotated images. All image annotations are in the PASCAL VOC data format introduced in the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge. Each image has its annotation that contains pixel coordinates of the bounding box corners for each object in the image. In our dataset, a single object per image is present -- the chased RC car. The data were collected from multiple locations around Czechia, on various surfaces, and also under different lighting conditions. The majority of images were collected by a ZED Stereo camera attached to the chasing RC car. Around 5% of the collected images were taken with smartphone Xiaomi Mi 8.
